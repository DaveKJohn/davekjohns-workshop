<#
Creates the changelog entry file for the current branch in the repo root:
<branch-name-with-hyphens>.md, with branch name, date, and branch type already filled in.

Usage:
  .\scripts\release\new-changelog-entry.ps1 -Title "Short title of the change"

Branch type is derived from the branch prefix via the shared table in
scripts/lib/branch-info.ps1 (feat/fix/docs/chore).
Unknown prefix -> falls back to "Chore" with a warning, adjust it yourself in the file.

Internal handoff from new-branch.ps1: that script invokes this file as a child process without
-Title, and passes the title instead via the environment variable CLAUDE_NEWBRANCH_TITLE. Reason:
free text (e.g. copied from an external issue/PR title) as a standalone CLI argument across a
native process boundary is an injection primitive (quotes/backslashes can break the child
process's argv reconstruction); environment variable values do not go through argv requoting. If
-Title is given explicitly (standalone use), it always wins; only when -Title is at its own
default AND the env var is set is the env var used.
#>

param(
    [string]$Title = "TODO: title"
)

$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"

# See the handoff explanation above: only adopt it if the param is still at its own default, so
# an explicit -Title (standalone use) always keeps precedence.
if ($Title -eq "TODO: title" -and $env:CLAUDE_NEWBRANCH_TITLE) {
    $Title = $env:CLAUDE_NEWBRANCH_TITLE
}

# Repo root -- dual context: if a consumer runs the shared plugin mirror, CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
# supplies its repo root; in the workshop root (or outside a session) it falls back to the git
# root. This way the SAME file works in both locations, and the root copy and the plugin mirror
# stay byte-identical (guarded by the shared-scripts drift lint).
