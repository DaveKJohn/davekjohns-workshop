### Globalize two verbatim-shared boundary rules into agent-shared/ · Chore · 2026-07-24

DRY cleanup (Ravi): two boundary bullets that were word-for-word identical across many `specialists`
agent-defs now live in a single shared source each and are filled in by `build-agent-defs.ps1` via
the existing shared-block mechanism. The rendered agent-def text is unchanged (generator `-Check`
in sync) — only the sentinel comments are added; no behavioral change.

- New sources: `agent-shared/no-conversation-history.md` (wrapped in 14 defs) and
  `agent-shared/no-commit-push-pr.md` (wrapped in the 10 defs carrying the exact wording).
- Deliberately left alone: the shorter no-PR-clause variant (02-09, 06-16) and the
  production-environment tail variants (04-11, 04-12) — legitimate role nuances, not duplication.
  The lifehub/shopify/ecomm plugins use a differently-worded conversation-history variant and were
  not touched (verbatim-only promotion).
- One incidental normalization: 06-24's PR bullet was on a single line; it now matches the
  canonical two-line wrap of the other nine — same wording.

Generator `-Check`, the lint gate, and all test suites are green.
