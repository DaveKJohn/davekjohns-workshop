# connectors/ — the registry of connected repos

This is the registry of **which repos have installed this family's plugins and whether they are
still in sync with this repo** — one `<repo>.json` manifest per connected repo, directly in this
directory, each containing the extension inventory per plugin. The connector *is* the repo. This
README is the doctrine; the manifests are the data.

**The registry deliberately lives at the family level, next to the plugin directories — not inside
them.** The marketplace sources point to the plugin directories themselves, so this registry does
*not* travel with consumers' plugin caches: this way, no consumer sees another's manifests
(decision by Dave, July 16, 2026, after the security review). The registry is workshop
administration.

## The doctrine: this repo is the source of truth

davekjohns-workshop works like a **Customer Data Platform**: all changes to shared plugin content
(agent defs, manuals, persona bodies, skills) **land here first**, and are only then synced out to
the connected repos — never the other way around (see the safety rules in the repo
[`CLAUDE.md`](../../../CLAUDE.md)). If an improvement nevertheless originates in a consumer, that
is an **inbound signal**: the change is first brought back here and then synced out again.

**The standing inbound route** (agreed with Dave, July 16, 2026): if a session in a consuming repo
discovers core improvements (something for the shared agent defs, manuals, persona bodies, or
skills — not lens work), that session does not build it itself, but opens an **issue on this repo**
with the label **`inbound`** — template:
[`inbound-verbeterpunt`](../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/inbound-verbeterpunt.md). This way nothing
gets lost and every workshop session has a visible backlog; the workshop processes it through the
normal chain (branch → reviews → PR on Dave's word → release bump), after which the consumer gets
it back via the plugin update. The only legitimate bridge on the consumer side is a deliberately
temporary note in its own repo lens, which disappears again after the sync.

An important nuance — **what syncs and what doesn't**:

- **Synced (source here):** the portable persona bodies (everything above the
  `## Specific to this repo` marker) and all plugin content itself (agent defs, manuals, skills).
- **Not synced (repo-specific):** the `## Specific to this repo` slot of each extension — the repo
  lens differs per consumer and belongs there. The registry only tracks *that* a lens exists,
  never what it contains.
- **Why extensions cannot live only here:** the session in a consuming repo reads the lens files
  at runtime from its **own checkout** (agent defs refer to them, and the orchestrator's persona
  is loaded via an `@`-import in the repo CLAUDE.md). The copy in the consumer is therefore
  technically necessary; this registry + the check keep it honest.

## Privacy boundary (hard rule)

This repo is **public**. Manifests therefore contain **metadata** only: repo name, plugin,
extension inventory (only `<group>-<id>` numbers), and a relative checkout path. **Never** lens
content, absolute machine paths, or other data from the (private) consuming repos. The relative
`localCheckout` paths reveal the sibling layout of the local checkouts; that is a deliberately
accepted degree of transparency (security review, July 16, 2026).

## The manifest format

```json
{
  "repo": "DaveKJohn/life-hub",
  "visibility": "private",
  "localCheckout": "../life-hub",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "id": "specialists@davekjohns-workshop",
      "extensions": ["01-01", "05-05"]
    }
  ],
  "notes": ""
}
```

- `localCheckout` is **relative to the root of this repo** (the workshop checkout); if the
  checkout is not on the machine, the check skips it. Absolute paths and paths outside the scope
  root are rejected by the check.
- `plugins` contains, per installed plugin, that plugin's `extensions` inventory.
- `notes` is the human summary/explanation; updated when something changes substantively, not on
  every check.
- **The manifest deliberately has no version bookkeeping (anymore)** (decision by Dave, July 20,
  2026): the check reads the actually installed version from the machine record
  (`installed_plugins.json`), and a `syncedVersion` field duplicating those numbers produced
  nothing but maintenance PRs while nobody was watching the signals anymore.

## The check

[`scripts/sync/check-connectors.ps1`](../../../scripts/sync/check-connectors.ps1) runs the two-way
check across all manifests: plugin still enabled, registered extensions present (outbound),
unregistered extensions flagged (inbound), the machine version against the source, and per
consumer the content drift check
([`check-consumer-drift.ps1`](../../../scripts/lint/check-consumer-drift.ps1)). Run it at the
start of a workday or session:

```powershell
.\scripts\sync\check-connectors.ps1              # everything
.\scripts\sync\check-connectors.ps1 -SkipDrift   # registry checks only (fast)
```

Syncing itself remains **pull-based per consumer**: each connected repo pulls changes in its own
session, under its own governance — this registry signals, it never writes cross-repo.

## Persona drift: how to read a DRIFTED report (doctrine)

Recorded after the drift investigation of July 17, 2026 (Rebecca; dossier
`persona-drift-doctrine`), which established across all seven reports at the time: **zero**
deliberate changes to portable bodies, one genuine lag, and six false positives caused by one
structural path difference.

- **There is no "deliberately divergent" status for the portable body.** Practice confirms the
  model: repo-specific content belongs in the `## Specific to this repo` slot (the lens), and a
  desired change to the portable part goes through the inbound route above — never as a permanent
  local divergence. So the check does not need to facilitate or mark deliberate drift.
- **Lens-only personas produce no body drift.** A correctly set-up persona lens (on the plugin
  path `.claude/plugins/claude-specialists/<plugin>/`) no longer carries a body copy -- the
  portable body comes from the plugin install via an `@`-import. Since #64 the index line is
  location-independent plain text (no path-depth link), so there is nothing left to normalize.
  `check-consumer-drift.ps1` recognizes the `> Repo-lens (lens-only persona)` blockquote and
  reports such a lens as `LENS-ONLY`; a consumer with an old, full body copy is still compared for
  real body drift.
- **A `DRIFTED` persona therefore always means a work item**: either lag (the source has moved on
  — refresh the copy from the source in a session of the consumer itself), or a not-yet-returned
  consumer change (bring that back through the inbound route first). Don't dismiss it, don't leave
  it sitting.
- **After a refresh, also update the manifest** (`notes`, and the `extensions` inventory if lenses
  were added or removed): the investigation found an already-performed refresh that was still
  administratively booked as open — the registry data should follow reality.

## The session check (automatic)

The `specialists` plugin carries a **SessionStart hook**
([`hooks/hooks.json`](../specialists/hooks/hooks.json) +
[`connector-sessioncheck.ps1`](../specialists/hooks/connector-sessioncheck.ps1)) that, when a
session starts — in every repo that has the plugin, so also life-hub and smartwatchbanden —
locates the workshop checkout and runs the connectors check there. Two guardrails from the
security review: the found path is **verified** first (a marker check on the marketplace name in
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — never run code on a guessed path), and outside the workshop
the check is **scoped** to the repo's own manifest, so a session never gets another consumer's
registry data into its context. Beyond that the hook is deliberately soft: no verified workshop
checkout means a notice and nothing more, only **blocking signals** (`[ERROR]`/`[DRIFTED]`) end up
as a compact summary in the session context, and the hook never blocks a session start (always
exit 0, read-only). `[INFO]` signals — registry administration about the sync state and the
registration of consumers: sometimes something to update here, often the business of another
machine or user, but in no case work worth interrupting a session start for — deliberately stay
silent at session start (decision by Dave, July 20, 2026); they are visible on a deliberate run of
`check-connectors.ps1` in the workshop. From this follows
a classification rule for extensions of the check (security review advice, July 20, 2026): a new
signal category that may be security-relevant (e.g. an indication of tampering) must never be
classified as `[INFO]`, but as `[ERROR]` — otherwise it silently stays out of sight at session
start. This hook is — alongside the `specialists-init` skill and the `roster-sessioncheck` hook
(the roster-sync feature) — one of the named, repo-neutral exceptions to the rule that plugins
carry no hooks/skills (see the root README). Mind the **version gate**: consumers only receive the
hook after a release bump plus a `claude plugin update` + session restart on their side.
