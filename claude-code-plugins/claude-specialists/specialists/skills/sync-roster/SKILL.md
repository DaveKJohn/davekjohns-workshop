  Stage the roster-sync catch-up after the roster-sessioncheck hook flags that a specialist is

# sync-roster -- the staged recovery for roster drift

When a plugin release adds a new specialist, a consumer that updates the plugin can end up with a
**roster** (the specialists table/list in `CLAUDE.md`) and **repo lenses** that lag behind. Layer 1
(`check-roster-sync.ps1`) detects that; layer 2 (the SessionStart `roster-sessioncheck` hook)
surfaces it at the top of a session. This skill is **layer 3**: it stages the catch-up so you only
have to review and place it.

It does the safe, mechanical part and leaves every judgment call -- and every write to the
governance doc -- to you.

## When to run it

Run it after the `roster-sessioncheck` hook (or a deliberate run of `check-roster-sync.ps1`) reports
`[ERROR]` lines like *"agent '06-24' ... has no roster row"* or *"... has no repo-lens"*. It is safe
to run repeatedly: it is additive and never overwrites.

## What the skill does

Run the bundled script from the **root of the consuming repo**:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/sync-roster/sync-roster.ps1"
```

The script:

1. **Delegates detection** to `check-roster-sync.ps1` (the single source of truth for what counts as
   drift) -- it runs the check and parses its `[ERROR]` lines, rather than re-implementing the
   enabled-plugins / cache-version / agent-id logic.
2. **Creates a lens scaffold** for each agent **missing a lens**, at
   `.claude/plugins/claude-specialists/<plugin>/<group>-<id>-extension.md`, using the same additive,
   BOM-less-LF, never-overwrite format `specialists-init` writes (the lens-only blockquote intro + a
   `## Specific to this repo (VUL-IN)` slot).
3. **Proposes a roster row** for each agent **missing a roster row**: it reads the agent's frontmatter
   (name + description) and prints a proposed markdown row (matching the roster's table/list style as
   best-effort) to stdout. It does **not** edit the roster / `CLAUDE.md`.
4. **Proposes a header reconcile** for each lens whose header still carries a **stale persona name**.
   An older scaffold baked the first name into the lens header (`# Sean · repo-lens`); after the
   agent-def is renamed that name is stale in every consumer. The skill prints the rename-proof,
   nameless replacement header (`# <group>-<id> · repo-lens`) for you to paste. New scaffolds are
   already nameless, so they never drift again (issue #145). It does **not** rewrite the lens file.
5. Prints a summary of what was staged, plus an explicit reminder that **main is sacred**: the skill
   wrote nothing to `CLAUDE.md` or any lens, and committed nothing.

## The human's follow-up (the judgment calls)

After the script:

1. **Fill in each lens.** Every created `*-extension.md` has a `## Specific to this repo (VUL-IN)`
   slot -- replace it with the specialist's repo-specific context (its domain, tasks, and the
   gatekeepers it works under). The portable craft stays in the plugin manual.
2. **Place the roster rows.** Paste the proposed row(s) into the roster and adjust them to the real
   columns/style of your table or list.
3. **Apply each header reconcile.** For each staged reconcile, replace the stale header line (and any
   remaining stale-name mention in the intro just below it) in the named lens with the nameless form.
4. **Branch + PR under your own governance.** Put the changes on a branch and open a PR -- never
   straight on `main`. Opening the PR follows this repo's own rules (in this workshop, on explicit
   request); the `open-pr` skill can do the push once you decide.

## Important

- **It never writes to `CLAUDE.md`, never commits, never touches a branch.** Recovery is *staged*, not
  applied -- the governance doc and the branch stay entirely in your hands.
- **Additive only.** An existing lens is left untouched; the skill is safe to run again.
- The source of this script lives in the workshop repo; do not modify it locally in a consumer. A
  change lands first in the source and travels via a release to the plugin mirror.
