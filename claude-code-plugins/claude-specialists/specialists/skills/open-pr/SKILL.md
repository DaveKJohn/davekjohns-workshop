  Push the current branch and open a Pull Request to main via the shared, centralized
  open-pr script from the plugin (single source of truth, issue #81) -- so a consumer does not have

  nothing is pushed and no PR is opened. Use this when a branch is ready and the PR may be
  opened (on explicit request).

# open-pr — the shared PR opener for consumers

This is the **plugin mirror** of `open-pr.ps1`: the same tested source as in the workshop repo,
shared here so consumers do not duplicate it. Background in
[issue #81](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/issues/81).

## What the skill does

Run the shared script from the **root of the consuming repo**:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/release/open-pr.ps1" -Title "feat: short title"
```

The script:

1. Runs the **repo's own lint gate** (via `Get-LintScript` from `repo-config`) and then **all
   test suites** (`scripts/tests/*.tests.ps1`) -- exactly like CI. An error blocks: nothing is
   pushed and no PR is opened. `-SkipLint` / `-SkipTests` are the deliberate escape valves.
2. Pushes the current branch and opens a PR to `main` via `gh`, with a label based on the
   branch prefix and a pre-filled PR body from `.github/pull_request_template.md` +
   the changelog entry file.

## Requirements in the consumer

The script is repo-agnostic, but reads its repo data from the **root** of the consumer
(dual-context via `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`):

- `scripts/repo-config.ps1` with `Get-RepoName` (the `gh --repo` target) and `Get-LintScript`
  (repo-root-relative path to the repo's own lint gate).
- `scripts/lib/branch-info.ps1` (label/type from the branch prefix).
- `scripts/tests/*.tests.ps1` (the test gate; convention, not config).
- `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `git`, and a logged-in `gh` CLI.

The `specialists-init` bootstrap puts `repo-config.ps1` + `branch-info.ps1` in place as a `VUL-IN`
scaffold. If they are missing -- or still set to `VUL-IN` -- the script stops before the dot-source
with a clear pointer instead of a raw error (#86); fill them in first (see the workshop repo as a
model).

## Important

- **A PR is only opened on explicit request** -- that remains the repo's governance rule,
  independent of this script.
- The source of this script lives in the workshop repo; do not modify it locally in the consumer. A
  change lands first in the source (`scripts/release/open-pr.ps1`) and then travels via a release to
  the plugin mirror -- guarded by the shared-scripts drift lint.
