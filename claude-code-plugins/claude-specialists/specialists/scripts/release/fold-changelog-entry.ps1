<#
Folds one or more changelog entry files (<branch-name>.md in the repo root) into the
## Pull Requests section of CHANGELOG.md, and then removes the entry files.

In fold-all mode (no -Branch) only files that are actually changelog entries are folded: an entry
opens with the '### <title> <midDot> <type> <midDot> <date>' H3 heading, so repo-root meta docs
(CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, ...) that open with an H1 are left untouched. -Branch mode targets
exactly the named entry and is unaffected.

The entry file is already compact (heading `### title - type - date` with middot separation,
followed by the description) -- matching the CHANGELOG format. When folding, fold only adds
'#NN - ' at the front of the title and, as the last line, the link `[PR #NN](url)`. The PR number +
url are fetched via `gh pr list` (on -Branch, or in fold-all mode derived from the file name) --
that can only happen after opening the PR. If no PR is found (e.g. a manual merge without a PR),
no number/url is added and the heading stays without #NN.

Usage:
  .\scripts\release\fold-changelog-entry.ps1 -Branch feat/new-plugin
  .\scripts\release\fold-changelog-entry.ps1              # folds all present entry files
  .\scripts\release\fold-changelog-entry.ps1 -RepoRoot C:\path\to\worktree   # explicit root (#101)

Run this on main, right after merging a branch (after Dave has approved the merge).
Commit the result (CHANGELOG.md + removed entry files) directly to main afterward.
