# Changelog

The history of the davekjohns-workshop marketplace: under **Pull Requests** every merged branch
with its PR, under **Releases** the recorded versions. How the mechanism works (entry files,
folding) is described in [`README.md`](README.md#contributing--changelog--pr-workflow).

## Pull Requests

Everything merged to `main` since the last release — newest at the top, one block per pull
request.

### #156 · Refine the CI-retrigger lesson for a very-late original run · Docs · 2026-07-23

Extends Derek's close/reopen lesson (`05-05-extension.md`, PR #152) with a nuance surfaced during
PR #155's own merge: the original `lint-en-tests` run was not truly missing, only extremely
delayed, and appeared shortly after the reopen-triggered run had already gone green. Adds two
practical refinements — verify via `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runs?head_sha=<sha>` that no
run exists at all before closing/reopening (ruling out an unrelated check suite from another
integration, e.g. `netlify`), and if a retrigger is already done and the late original run then
shows up, expect two runs briefly with `mergeStateStatus` dropping back to `BLOCKED`; wait for both
to go green and merge normally, never with `--admin`. Also aligns Chris's lens (`01-01-extension.md`)
to the same terminology: `main` is guarded by a ruleset, not classic branch protection, which
explains the "base branch policy" wording — that lens previously still said "branch protection".

### #155 · Harden open-pr invocation control and fix sync-roster description person · Chore · 2026-07-23

Applies the two must-fixes from Sylvester's own skill audit. `open-pr`'s `SKILL.md`
(`claude-code-plugins/claude-specialists/specialists/skills/open-pr/SKILL.md`) gets
`disable-model-invocation: true` in its frontmatter, removing the autonomous Skill-tool invocation
surface in support of the constitution rule that a PR is only opened on Dave's explicit word — the
same pattern `start-task` already uses in the Shopify family. Note this only closes the Skill-tool
path; a direct Bash call to `scripts/release/open-pr.ps1` or the plugin mirror is not gated by this
field, so the actual guarantee remains the CLAUDE.md constitution rule plus branch discipline.

`sync-roster`'s `SKILL.md`
(`claude-code-plugins/claude-specialists/specialists/skills/sync-roster/SKILL.md`) gets its
description rewritten from second person ("for you to paste", "you want ... done for you") to third
person, same content, matching the style of every other skill description. Verified: the lint gate
(`check-plugin-integrity.ps1`) accepts the new field with no findings, and neither description is
duplicated elsewhere in the repo (plugin.json, generated mirrors, or drift-lint fixtures).

### #154 · Flatten release notes into per-major folders · Chore · 2026-07-23

Flattens the release-notes layout from per-minor folders
(`releases/development/<X.Y>/<X.Y.Z>.md`) to one folder per major
(`releases/development/<X>.x/<X.Y.Z>.md`) — so all 1.x notes now live in `1.x/` and all 2.x notes
in `2.x/`, matching the per-major grouping already applied to the overview table (#152). The 27
existing 1.x notes and the two 2.x notes were moved via `git mv` (renames preserved); the empty
minor folders are gone.

Because the depth is unchanged (a single `<X>.x` folder replaces the single `<X.Y>` folder), the
root-relative links inside the notes (`../../../`) keep resolving — no note body was touched.
Updated: `cut-release.ps1` + `release-lib.ps1` now derive `<major>.x` (was `<major>.<minor>`); the
29 note-path links in `releases/README.md` + the `## Releases` block in `CHANGELOG.md`, the four
per-plugin `RELEASE.md` cards, the descriptive `<X.Y>` references in `README.md`/`05-06-extension.md`,
and the `release-lib` test's expected paths. Git tags (`vX.Y.Z`) are unaffected — they point to
commits, not paths. Archived note bodies keep their original (historical, sometimes Dutch) path
mentions on purpose. Lint gate green (dead-link scan clean); all test suites pass.
