# Changelog

The history of the davekjohns-workshop marketplace: under **Pull Requests** every merged branch
with its PR, under **Releases** the recorded versions. How the mechanism works (entry files,
folding) is described in [`README.md`](README.md#contributing--changelog--pr-workflow).

## Pull Requests

Everything merged to `main` since the last release — newest at the top, one block per pull
request.

### #141 · README: note that per-plugin CHANGELOG/RELEASE.md now group by category · Docs · 2026-07-22

The "Cutting a release" section (step 3) predated the grouped-release-output change: it described
the per-plugin CHANGELOG.md and RELEASE.md card without mentioning that their entries are now
grouped by category. Added a sentence noting that all three outputs (full notes, per-plugin
CHANGELOG, RELEASE.md card) group entries by category -- Features, Fixes, Documentation,
Maintenance, Other -- with features and fixes at the top.

### #140 · CLAUDE.md: acknowledge Bianca #02 (main-loop persona, no role here) · Docs · 2026-07-22

README.md names the main-loop personas as Chris #01, Bianca #02, Derek #05, Rendall #06, and
Bianca's persona template exists (`personas/03-02-persona.md`, the Biographer), but CLAUDE.md did
not mention her at all -- not in the roster, routing, or the "also enabled" note. Because she is a
main-loop persona (not a subagent), the roster-sessioncheck hook cannot catch the gap either. Added
a sentence to the roster note stating she exists in the plugin but is deliberately not rostered or
@-imported here (this maintenance repo has no intake-interview work), so README and CLAUDE.md agree.

### #139 · repo lenses 06-23/06-24: stale Dutch section names -> English · Docs · 2026-07-22

Two repo lenses still named the agent-def sections by their old Dutch labels after the English
migration: Sean's `06-23-extension.md` referred to the "Grenzen" block, and Ravi's
`06-24-extension.md` to **Grenzen** (Boundaries) / **Werkwijze** (Working method). The agent-def
section labels are English now (**Boundaries** / **Working method**), so both references were
updated to match.

### #138 · README: stale Dutch 'Grenzen' -> 'Boundaries' section name · Docs · 2026-07-22

The "Shared agent-def blocks" section of README.md still referred to the agent-def boundaries
section by its old Dutch name ("under **Grenzen** (the boundaries section)"). The agent-def section
labels were migrated to English long ago (they read **Boundaries** / **Working method** now), so the
reference was stale. Updated to "in the **Boundaries** section".

### #137 · document the wait-for-CI step before merge (Chris lens + README) · Docs · 2026-07-22

The PR flow (Chris's lens 01-01-extension.md + README "Contributing" step 4) described the chain as
"open -> merge -> fold" without noting that branch protection on `main` blocks the merge until the
required CI check `lint-en-tests` is green -- a merge attempt before then returns BLOCKED. Someone
following the chain literally would try to merge immediately and get stuck. Added the explicit
"wait for CI green before merge" step in both places.

### #136 · ship-pr.ps1: open PR -> wait for CI -> merge -> fold in one command · Feat · 2026-07-22

Adds `scripts/release/ship-pr.ps1`, which orchestrates the whole "on Dave's word" PR chain that was
being run by hand every time: open-pr.ps1 (lint + test gate, push, open) -> look up the PR number ->
wait for the required CI check `lint-en-tests` (gh pr checks --watch) -> merge (gh pr merge --merge,
no --admin so the CI gate is never bypassed) -> checkout main, fold the entry, commit + push the
fold. Stops on the first failure and never forces a merge past red CI. `-NoMerge` opens the PR only;
`-SkipLint`/`-SkipTests` pass through to open-pr. Native git/gh calls run through the shared
Invoke-NativeCapture helper (#107 stderr guard). Deliberately workshop-local (like cut-release.ps1),
not mirrored to the plugin: merge policy and the CI check name are repo-specific. Run only on Dave's
explicit request, exactly like open-pr.ps1. Test gap noted in the script header: like open-pr it
drives live git/gh and is not covered by an automated suite (its sub-steps are tested on their own).

### #135 · group per-plugin CHANGELOG + RELEASE.md by category, short labels · Feat · 2026-07-22

The consumer-facing release output now groups entries by category, matching the full release notes.
Previously only `Build-ReleaseNotes` (the `releases/development/*.md` notes) grouped by type; the
per-plugin `CHANGELOG.md` sections and `RELEASE.md` cards listed entries flat. Introduced a single
source for the category order + labels (`Get-ReleaseCategories`) and a shared renderer
(`Format-CategorizedEntries`), used by all three generators. Labels shortened to `Features`,
`Fixes`, `Documentation`, `Maintenance`, `Other` (Dave's decision), applied everywhere including the
full notes. Heading nesting follows the container: single-release views (full notes + `RELEASE.md`
card) use `## <Category>` -> `### <entry>`; the stacked per-plugin `CHANGELOG.md` uses
`## v<X.Y.Z>` -> `### <Category>` -> `#### <entry>`. The `RELEASE.md` card also drops its redundant
inner `## v<X.Y.Z>` line (the `# Release v<X.Y.Z>` header already states the version). Takes effect
from the next release; the already-cut v1.15.1 artifacts are unchanged. Tests extended (release-lib
108 asserts): updated category-label + nesting assertions plus new coverage for the shared helpers.
