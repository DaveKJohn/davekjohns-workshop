# Contributing — changelog & PR workflow

Changes to this repo go through a branch + Pull Request to `main`, with a folded
changelog entry — the same workflow as the consuming repos. The steps:

1. **Branch — its changelog entry comes along in the same move:**
   [`scripts/task/new-branch.ps1`](scripts/task/new-branch.ps1)`-Name <prefix>/<short-name> -Title "…"`
   creates (or idempotently resumes) the `<prefix>/<short-name>` branch and, as a child step,
   scaffolds `<branch-name>.md` in the repo root (heading + date + type already filled in) via
   [`scripts/release/new-changelog-entry.ps1`](scripts/release/new-changelog-entry.ps1) — a branch is
   never entry-less. Valid prefixes (prefix → label → changelog type): `feat/` → enhancement → Feat ·
   `fix/` → bug → Fix · `docs/` → documentation → Docs · `chore/` → documentation → Chore
   (maintenance: scripts, tooling, config). The table is in
   [`scripts/lib/branch-info.ps1`](scripts/lib/branch-info.ps1).
2. **Work + commit** on the branch: write the entry file's description, then commit it along with
   the rest of the work.
3. **Open the PR:** [`scripts/release/open-pr.ps1`](scripts/release/open-pr.ps1)`-Title "…"` first runs
   the **lint gate** [`scripts/lint/check-plugin-integrity.ps1`](scripts/lint/check-plugin-integrity.ps1)
   (valid manifests, agent-def frontmatter, no dead links) and then the **test gate** (all
   `scripts/tests/*.tests.ps1`, exactly as CI does); on an error or a failing suite nothing is pushed and
   no PR is opened. If both gates pass, the script pushes and opens the PR with label + auto-filled body.
   The same gate also runs as **CI** on GitHub ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml):
   lint + all test suites, on every PR and every push to `main`) — so a PR created outside the
   scripts still passes through it all the same.
4. **Merge** (on Dave's word) — after the required CI check `lint-en-tests` has gone green. Branch
   protection on `main` blocks the merge until then (a merge attempt before it passes returns
   `BLOCKED`); wait for CI, then merge.
5. **Fold:** on `main`, right after the merge,
   [`scripts/release/fold-changelog-entry.ps1`](scripts/release/fold-changelog-entry.ps1)`-Branch <name>`
   folds the entry file into the `## Pull Requests` section of [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) (with
   `#NN` + PR link), derives a `Plugins:` line from the PR's files along the way (for the per-plugin
   CHANGELOGs — see [Cutting a release](releases/README.md#cutting-a-release)), and removes the entry file;
   commits that directly on `main`.

## Cutting a release

A release is a **captured moment**: all plugins get the same version number
(**lockstep, repo-wide**) and the state is tagged as `vX.Y.Z`. A release is cut **only on Dave's
explicit request** and deliberately does **not** go through a branch + PR: like the fold commit, the
release commit is a permitted direct-on-`main` action (the second exception to "everything via
branch + PR"). The full mechanics — the `cut-release.ps1` steps, the per-plugin `CHANGELOG.md`s and
`RELEASE.md` cards, and the guardrails — are described in
[`releases/README.md`](releases/README.md#cutting-a-release), not repeated here.
