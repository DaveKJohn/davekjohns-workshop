### Translate the GEGENEREERD, bewerk sentinel marker to English across the agent defs · Docs · 2026-07-21

Translated the last Dutch fragment in the agent-def shared-block sentinel comments to English, in
line with the repo-wide English-content norm: `<!-- BEGIN shared:NAME -- GEGENEREERD, bewerk
agent-shared/NAME.md -->` becomes `<!-- BEGIN shared:NAME -- GENERATED, edit agent-shared/NAME.md
-->`. The marker is literal per-file text (the generator preserves the BEGIN/END sentinel lines
as-is and only fills the body between them), so all 21 agent-defs across the three plugins were
updated directly, plus the one docstring example in `agent-shared-lib.ps1` and the one test
fixture string in `agent-shared.tests.ps1`. No regex in the generator or the lint gate matched the
Dutch text, so nothing there needed changing. Verified: `build-agent-defs.ps1 -Check` (in sync),
`check-plugin-integrity.ps1` (0 errors), and all `scripts/tests/*.tests.ps1` suites green.
